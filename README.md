## About Watch Movies

Watch Movies is a tiny application with poposer of learning, I used an api called themoviedb, which is really good for movies. here it goes a list of what you can do for now on the app.

- Login System, you must have an account in the website to go to home page where all the movies will be.
- You can update everything in your account besides password for now.
- You can see list of movies in your home page select them by genre or the left side list which inside of the app I called MainList.
- The app has pagination for the movies.
- You can select a movie and a window will pop out and you will be able to see the title of the movie, description and some other aspects of the movie for now.


## What I used?

- **[Laravel]**
- **[Vue]**
- **[Some packges from npm and composer like Image/intervetion]**

## How to run

- Download the package.
- You need composer and node.js/npm)
- Enter in the directory folder you have the project
- Run in "npm install && compose install" to install all dependencies
- after run the "php artisan migrate" to run all the migrations
- If the migration doesn't run please check in database folder and see if there's a file named app.sqlite, if there's not you create it and run "php artisan migrate" again.
- Now you can start your server by typing "php artisan server".



If you have any questions or problems just say something.

## THIS APP ISN'T THE FINAL VERSION.
