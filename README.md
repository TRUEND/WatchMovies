Watch Movies is a tiny application with poposer of learning, I used an api called themoviedb, which is really good for movies. here it goes a list of what you can do for now on the app.

- Login System, you must have an account in the website to go to home page where all the movies will be.
- You can update everything in your account besides password for now.
- You can see list of movies in your home page select them by genre or the left side list which inside of the app I called MainList.
- The app has pagination for the movies.
